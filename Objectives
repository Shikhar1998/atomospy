List your objectives here:

Short Term:
1. Simulate Special Relativity:
	1. Lorentz Transformation
	2. Einstein Energy mass equivalence

2. General Theory of Relativity:
	1. Implement the '10 in 1' mathematical equation of
	relativity.
	2. Create a model for gravitational waves(Earth sun - simulation(but with maths)).

Long term:
1. Create a model for strings:
	1. Why I did relativity first?(I know you will ask)
	Reason (Baby steps): If we implement something in 4 dimensions
	we will have a firm ground and idea for dealing with 10 dimensions.
	Moreover, we will have a dual purpose library, and I am
	sure no other library offers the support for relativity.
2. Create the basis for 10 dimensions.
3. Create a mathematic model for the sub-atomic particles.
4. Create a 10-d to 3-d model of the strings.
